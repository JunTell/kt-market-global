The penalty may vary depending on the plan selected at activation, contract conditions, and discount type.\n\n• Even after 6 months, you cannot change to the following plans:\n1. No-contract plan 2. Yogo/Direct plan 3. MVNO plan\n\n• The public subsidy benefit applies based on a 24-month contract. The suspension period is not included in the contract period, and if canceled mid-term within the contract period, a penalty for the remaining period may be charged.\n\n• If you have used it for more than 18 months after activation with a 24-month contract, the public subsidy penalty for device change is deferred and not charged.

A 5.9% installment interest calculated by the equal principal and interest method is added here.\n\n• If you are curious about the installment interest, search for 'loan calculator' on Naver and enter the discounted device price and the desired number of installment months. You can easily check the total installment interest.\n\n• You can pay the installment amount at any time even after activation with carrier installment. Full payment as well as partial payment is possible. Pay comfortably when you want.\n\n• If you wish to pay in full, please pay via My KT (App), 114 (Customer Center), or a nearby KT store within the month of activation using a payment method (Cash/Card/Naver Pay/Kakao Pay).\n\n• The number of interest-free installment months for credit cards is the same as the number of interest-free installment months provided by card companies at general merchants. Interest-free installments are possible for 2~5 months, and up to 10~12 months depending on the card company, so please contact your card company for detailed conditions.\n\n• You can check payment details and receipts at any time on the My KT app or KT homepage for full payment.",
